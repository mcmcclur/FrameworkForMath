# Mark's Framework Observations

I've been using the Observable notebook since late 2018, when it was beta.observablehq.com. This Framework project outlines how some of the Observable tricks I've learned translate over to Framework. Given my background as a Professor of Mathematics and Statistics, there's plenty of stuff mathematical typesetting, generating mathematical images, and using tools like MathJS. I'm sure this will grow, as well.

If you're interested in some of the data visualization work I've done, you might check out

Generally, I'd put a list of pointers to the content here but Observable Framework has that all so nicely organized in the sidebar!

  - The TeX macro
  - Using KaTeX
  - Using MathJax
  - Programmatic use of MathJax
  - Comparing KaTeX and MathJax
- Plot
  - Graphing functions
  - Overlaying the TeX macro
  - Incorporating MathJax SVG
